Governments around the world promise citizens many things in order to make their lives
better. But often times these governments fail to deliver on their promises and they get
away with it because no one holds them accountable.
World Vision sought to solve this and set up CVA, citizen voice and action. It’s an ideology
that empowers individuals to come together and stand as one community, holding
governments accountable for their promises and trying to have a positive impact on society
both locally and globally.

CVA groups create action plans to track government commitments, ensuring the right
standards are met. They collaborate with one another to ensure that promises from the
government don’t become empty promises.
Everything from action plans to tracking government commitments is done on pen and
paper usually in a centralised location.

This means that CVA groups cannot work remotely, a concern that has been highlighted
with COVID-19. Paperwork can get damaged and misplaced and lastly archived paperwork
might take weeks to go through to find the relevant piece of information needed.
Our Solution directly helps CVA Groups with all of these challenges. We have created an App
and admin dashboard which allows CVA groups to store their findings online. Collaborate
and communicate with one another and track the progress of government commitments.
This leads to efficiency in documentation and allows CVA groups to work remotely. Through
this app CVA groups can track their governments commitments and ensure that they
receive the right standards that the governments have promised!
